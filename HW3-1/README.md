# :white_check_mark: CSC 583 HW#3-1 Setup Instructions

The base code is a notebook file, "hw3-1_rnn_textclassification.ipynb".  Your task is to fill in the sections marked '# TODO' and answer questions marked "Write your answer here".  You must also write your name, course number etc. at the top of the file.

**IMPORTANT HINT**: Consult the baked-in output (["583_HW3-1_startup.pdf"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GHXvdWw1oO5r77HqXy1SLosnIYGmGIWm/view?usp=drive_link) ) to verify the correctness as you develop your code.

## :rocket: Setup

The base code has been tested on **Google Colab** -- it runs as is with no additional setup.  You are encouraged to write code there.  

However, if you like to use your local platform, you are more than welcome to do so.  But you must set it up by yourself (assuming you know how).
